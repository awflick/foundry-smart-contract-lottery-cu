# Foundry Smart Contract Lottery

This project implements a decentralized lottery (raffle) smart contract using Solidity and Foundry. It was built as part of the **Cyfrin Foundry Fundamentals** course and covers key concepts including contract deployment, testing, automation, and interaction with Chainlink VRF & Keepers (Automation).

## ðŸ§  Key Features

- Lottery smart contract with entrance fee
- Chainlink VRF for provable randomness
- Chainlink Automation for auto-execution
- Full suite of unit and integration tests
- Automated deployment and helper scripts
- Modular config for testnet/mainnet environments

## ðŸ§ª Tech Stack

- [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) - Smart contract development toolchain
- Solidity - Smart contract language
- Chainlink - VRF and Automation integrations
- Anvil - Local testnet
- Sepolia - Ethereum testnet

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

### 1. Clone the repo and init submodules
```bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/awflick/foundry-smart-contract-lottery-cu.git
cd foundry-smart-contract-lottery-cu
```

### 2. Install Foundry
```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
foundryup
```

### 3. Build & Test
```bash
forge build
forge test
```

### 4. Run Scripts
```bash
forge script script/DeployRaffle.s.sol --broadcast --rpc-url $SEPOLIA_RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY
```

> ðŸ’¡ Make sure you have `.env` variables set for RPC URL, private key, and Chainlink configs.

## ðŸ“– Course Reference

This repository is part of the **[Cyfrin Foundry Fundamentals](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC/foundry-fund-me-f23)** course taught by [Patrick Collins](https://github.com/PatrickAlphaC), designed to teach professional-grade smart contract development using Foundry.

## âœ… Todo / Ideas

- [ ] Add a front-end interface for raffle entry and status display
- [ ] Add time-based constraints on lottery draws
- [ ] Extend support to other networks (e.g., Polygon, Arbitrum)
